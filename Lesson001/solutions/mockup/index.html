	<h1>Animal Facts</h1>
	<h2>Cat Facts</h2>
		<p>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, 
			you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top 
			of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved 
			in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 
			300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare 
			and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. 
			You are nothing to me but just another target. I will 
			wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which 
			has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. 
			You think you can get away with saying that shit to me 
			over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am 
			contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and 
			your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare 
			for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic 
			little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. 
			I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven 
			hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am 
			I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access 
			to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and 
			I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass 
			off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you 
			could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” 
			comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have 
			held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and 
			now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit 
			fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, 
			kiddo.
